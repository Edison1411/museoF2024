            <Mark>"It was amazing!</Mark> I had never seen so many ancient things in one place before. 
            I loved seeing the dinosaurs and the Egyptian artifacts. 
            My favorite parts were when the guide told us stories about how people lived in ancient times.

            "The visit to <Mark>the museum was fascinating</Mark>. As someone who loves history,
             each room was like a treasure trove of knowledge. I was able to spend hours examining each exhibit,
              reading the descriptions and absorbing the cultural wealth they offered.

            "Visiting the museum was the highlight of my trip. Seeing art and artifacts from cultures
            I had only read about in history books was surreal. 
            I learned a lot about the local culture and history of the country I was visiting. 
            Also, the architecture of the museum <Mark>"In itself it was impressive. 
            It was definitely an experience that I will remember forever."</Mark>
